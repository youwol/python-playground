/**
 * ## Context
 *
 * Context objects are used to track execution flows in the module's implementation
 * (or at other places). It enables:
 * -    meaningful reporting of what is going on (wrong or not)
 * during module's execution (see also [[Journal]])
 * -    understanding the bottleneck in terms of performances
 * -    [[Log]] broadcasting to multiple destinations
 *
 * Context can be used in synchronous or asynchronous scenarios, the following example
 * illustrates both usages (code is simplified to only keep the relevant points):
 *
 * ```typescript
 *  class Module extends ModuleFlux{
 *
 *      output$ : Pipe<unknown>
 *
 *      constructor(params) {
 *          super(params)
 *              addInput({
 *                  onTriggered: ({data, context}) =>
 *                      this.process(data, context)
 *              })
 *              this.addOutput({id:'output'})
 *      }
 *
 *      process(data, context: Context) {
 *
 *          let data1 = context.withChild( 'syncStep', () => syncStep(data, context) )
 *          ctx.info("Synchronous step was successful", data1)
 *
 *          asyncStep(data1, context).subscribe(
 *              (result) => {
 *                  this.output$.next(result);
 *                  // it is always the responsibility of the developer to close
 *                  // the context provided to 'onTriggered'
 *                  context.end()
 *               };
 *              (error) => {
 *                  ctx.error( error )
 *                  context.end()
 *              }
 *      }
 *
 *      syncStep( data, context: Context){
 *
 *          context.info("Starting sync step", data)
 *          let value // = ... the result of some computations
 *          return value
 *      }
 *
 *      async asyncStep( data: unknown, context: Context): Observable<any> {
 *
 *          let ctx = context.startChild('async step')
 *          ctx.info("Starting async step, expect 10 values to come", data)
 *
 *          return from(
 *              // a source of async data, e.g. requests, multi-threaded computations, etc
 *              ).pipe(
 *              tap( (value) => ctx.info("got a value", value))
 *              take(10),
 *              reduce( (acc,e) => acc.concat(e), [])
 *              tap( (acc) => {
 *                  ctx.info("got all 10 values", acc)
 *                  ctx.end()
 *              })
 *          )
 *      }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * > #### Synchronous cases
 * > The Context class provide the method [[withChild]], the developer is not
 * > in charge to *start* or *end* the child context as it is automatically managed.
 * > If an error is thrown and not catched during the callback execution, the child context end (along with its parents),
 * > the error is reported in the child context, and finally the error is re-thrown.
 *
 * > #### Asynchronous cases
 * > The Context class provides the method [[startChild]] & [[end]].
 * > It is the developer responsibility to call these methods at the right time, and also
 * > to deal with eventual exceptions.
 *
 * The natural representation of a context (as presented in [flux-builder](https://github.com/youwol/flux-builder)),
 * is a tree view representing the tree structure of the function calls chain.
 * The children of a context can be of two types:
 * -    [[Log]] : an element of log, either [[InfoLog]], [[WarningLog]] or [[ErrorLog]]
 * -    [[Context]] : a child context
 *
 * ### Logs broadcasting
 *
 * Context objects can includes broadcasting [[Context.channels$]] to multiple
 * destinations and with different filters/maps through [[LogChannel]].
 *
 * Context from modules' execution use 2 channels:
 * -    all logs are broadcasted to [[ModuleFlux.logs$]]
 * -    error logs are broadcasted to [[Environment.errors$]]
 *
 *
 * ### A note about user-context
 *
 * The Context object also conveys the **user-context** (it is discussed along with [[Adaptor]]).
 * The library can not automatically forward the user-context when output are sent:
 * it is not always as meaningful as expected, and the asynchronous (possibly multi-threaded)
 *  nature of module's processes makes it close to impossible (at least we did not find a safe way of doing so ðŸ¤«).
 *
 * This explains why, when emitting a value through an output pipe, you should explicitly pass
 *  back the context that has been provided to you at the first place (to the *onTriggered* callback).

/**
 * ## Log
 *
 * The class Log is the base class for the concrete types [[ErrorLog]], [[WarningLog]] and [[InfoLog]].
 * It is one of the two [[Context]]'s structuring entities (the other one being a child [[Context]]).
 *
 * Log objects are central in Flux for the reporting mechanism (the same way [[Context]] are).
 * In particular, one interesting feature related to log & reporting is the possibility for the developer
 * of modules to register custom view factories associated to some data types.
 * Doing so allows to include in the Flux journals adapted and interactive views to help
 * the builder of Flux applications to better understand the data transformation flow during a processing.
 * Examples include interactive 3D visualization, on the fly reporting of convergence
 * results in 2D graphs, etc.
 * The registration of the factories is handled by the class [[Journal]].

 * The class gathers:

 * -    registered custom views associated to some particular data (usually w/ their type)

 * ### Registering a custom view
 *
 * Below is an example of a module willing to provide feedbacks on a convergence process
 * as it goes. Looking at the journal while the module is running would present a 2D graph with live updates.
 *
 * The library [flux-view](https://github.com/youwol/flux-view) is used in the example, the same
 * can most likely be done with your favorite library (an HTMLElement is required at the end).
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as Plotly from 'plotly.js-gl2d-dist-min'
 * import Journal from './flux-core'
 * import {VirtualDOM, render} from './flux-view'
 * import {compute} from 'somewhere'
 *
 * class DataView{
 *      source$ = new Subject<Array<[number, number]>()
 *      constructor(){}
 * }
 *
 * function journalView( data$ : Observable<Array<[number,number]>) : HTMLElement{
 *      let id = uuidv4()
 *      let vDOM : VirtualDOM = {
 *          id,
 *          class: "w-100 h-100",
 *          connectedCallback: (div) =>
 *              elem.ownSubscriptions(
 *                  data$.subscribe( data => Plotly.newPlot(div, data) );
 *              )
